"""Historical lane issues, their superseding lanes, and the open issues that own open work.

Every register gate, consuming lane, owning issue and blocking issue names a
GitHub issue. The lane issues of the retired V3 and V4 programmes are all
closed; a register keeps such a number as labelled history and names the open
issue that owns the remaining work through ``live_owner``. Generated pages
render a historical number as "historical lane #n" beside its live owner.

``SUPERSEDED_LANE_SUCCESSORS`` records lanes that a later lane replaced while
the programme still ran; a claim gate names the successor lane, never the
superseded one. ``LIVE_OWNERS`` maps every historical lane that a register
still cites to the open issue that owns its remaining work. Add a lane here when
it closes, and update ``OPEN_ISSUES`` when the open physics issues change.
