"""Check Lean comment style and the in-file kernel-axiom audit blocks.

Two independent sections run over the Lean sources under ``Lean/``.

**Section 1, comment prose.**  ``docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`` binds code comments to
the same two constraints it binds prose to: state the exact research status,
and avoid machine-generated prose mannerisms.  ``tools/check_reader_style.py``
enforces that vocabulary on Markdown and TeX surfaces.  A Lean module docstring
is read by the same audience, so the same vocabulary applies, with one
mechanical difference: a Lean file is mostly code, and code must never trip a
prose rule.  A declaration called ``nowhere_dense``, a hypothesis called
``hstill``, a field called ``already_reduced``: all of those are identifiers,
and none of them is prose.  The scanner therefore masks every non-comment
character before matching, so only ``--``, ``/- -/``, ``/-- -/`` and ``/-! -/``
text can produce a violation.

**Section 2, kernel-axiom audit coverage.**  Most Lean modules end with a block
of ``#print axioms`` commands, so the build log carries the kernel dependency of
every theorem the module states.  A block that names only some of a module's
theorems is worse than no block: it reads as a complete audit.  Section 2 keeps
a registry of modules whose block covers every public theorem and lemma they
state, and fails when one of those blocks loses coverage.  Modules outside the
registry are reported by ``--axiom-coverage-report`` with their unaudited count
and are not failed, so the registry grows by deliberate registration.

A second registry covers companion audit modules.  ``Lean/Geometry/*AxiomAudit.lean``
and ``ObserverPatchHolography/EinsteinBranch/AxiomAudit.lean`` name the theorems
of other modules, through ``audit_*`` commands that fail the build on any axiom
outside the standard allowlist, or through ``#print axioms`` lines.  Each entry
of ``AXIOM_AUDIT_COMPANIONS`` binds one audit module to the source modules whose
every public theorem and lemma it must name.  Names are matched on their fully
qualified form, which the scanner computes from the ``namespace``, ``section``
and ``end`` commands of the source module; an audit line matches when its
argument equals that form or is a suffix of it on a component boundary, since an
audit module may ``open`` a namespace.  ``--axiom-coverage-report`` also lists,
for every audit module, the source modules it covers with their declared and
unaudited counts, and the modules that state public theorems without a receipt
anywhere.

# Companion audit modules and the source modules they audit in full. The key
# is the audit module, the value lists every source module whose public
# theorems and lemmas the audit module must all name, on the fully qualified
# form or a component-boundary suffix of it. A source module joins the list
# when the audit module names all of its theorems, and section 2 then keeps
# the list complete, so a theorem added to a listed source module without an
# audit line fails the check. A source module listed here may also carry its
# own in-file block; the two registries are independent.
