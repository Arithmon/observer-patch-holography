# Vendored external K7 sources

These files are third-party material, copied byte for byte so that the
[K7 / OPH gauge kinetic cross-control](../k7_gauge_kinetic_cross_control.md)
can be replayed offline. They are negative-control inputs only. They are not
OPH results, OPH evidence or OPH predictions, and the cross-control verdict
`NO_ADMISSIBLE_K7_GAUGE_VECTOR_ESTABLISHED_BY_PINNED_SOURCES` establishes no
OPH physics.

The cross-control receipt and the scale contract in [`../runtime/`](../runtime/)
record the Git blob and SHA-256 digest of each file, and their verifiers
reject any drift.

Author of the K7 framework paper: Brieuc de La Fourniere. The vendored texts
carry no licence statement of their own, so their redistribution status is
unknown; the upstream repositories are the authoritative copies. The main
paper contains its own predictions and relative links to upstream files that
are not vendored here; those links do not resolve inside this repository. The
file name `honest_ledger.md` is the upstream name and is kept so that the
pinned path and digests stay valid.
