# Yang–Mills finite repair-gap: the commuting-projection branch

This module carries one conditional result of B. Müller, *Explaining the
Yang–Mills Mass Gap with Observer-Patch Repair Dynamics*: a finite-gap
assembly for a family of pairwise commuting orthogonal projections.  It is
**not** a formalisation of the paper's noncommuting finite-stage theorem,
whose collar conditional expectations need not commute and whose gap argument
uses a Dobrushin/approximate-tensorisation hypothesis instead.

## Scope (read this first)

This module proves an **implication**, nothing more:

> IF the repair generator on a finite collar family has the special structural
> form assumed here, with each collar acting by an orthogonal projection
> `E_C`, the collars **mutually commuting**, their joint fixed space
> represented by `P₀`, and **finitely many** active collar types each carrying
> a **strictly positive** relaxation rate `c_C` (supplied directly to the
> theorem below), THEN the finite generator `L_r^rep = ∑_C c_C · (I − E_C)`
> dominates `c_* · (I − P₀)` with `c_* = min_C c_C > 0` (Proposition 8.1): a
> strictly positive finite-stage spectral gap.

Everything to the left of `THEN` is a **hypothesis** here.  In particular,
pairwise commutation is not derived from the Yang–Mills construction and is
discharged **nowhere** in Lean.  This file proves only the special
implication `commuting structure ⇒ finite gap`.

The result must not be substituted for, or described as, the paper's
noncommuting Dobrushin finite-stage theorem.  Nor can it be composed into the
continuum receipt merely because both conclusions are called a finite gap:
doing so would require a separate source-level proof that the collar
expectations commute and that this commuting branch satisfies the continuum
certificate's compatibility hypotheses.  No such bridge is present here.

One thing is deliberately **NOT** proved and **NOT** claimed:

* `Δ_YM = Δ_rep`. This is Müller's **Assumption 9.2**, the continuum
  certificate (Schwinger-function convergence, reflection positivity,
  Osterwalder–Schrader reconstruction, non-triviality). It is the genuine open
  problem and is **untouched**. The deliverable here is `Δ_rep`, the
  finite-stage *representation* gap, and **not** the physical Yang–Mills mass
  gap.

Two ingredients are proved in sibling modules and **imported** here, and they
carry different status in this API:

* `lemma_7_2`: scalar relaxation on one uniform hidden fiber, proved in
  `ObserverPatchHolography.YangMillsLemma72`.  It is re-exported here as a
  separate conditional theorem, and as `collar_rate_unique` in the sharper
  unique-scalar form, while no theorem in this module bridges its matrix `D`
  and coefficient `c_F` to the Hilbert-space collar projections and `rate`
  argument of `thm_7_3_finite_gap`;
* `prop_8_1`: the commuting-color finite-stage gap (`commuting ⇒ gap`), proved
  in `ObserverPatchHolography.YangMillsProp81`.

This file is the **setup plus the Theorem 7.3 / Lemma 7.4 assembly**.
`thm_7_3_finite_gap` assembles the directly assumed positive rates with the
uniform floor and `prop_8_1`; it carries zero `sorry`s and no project-level
axioms.  It does **not** consume `lemma_7_2`.  A source theorem connecting the
uniform-fiber relaxation data to the collar-rate argument is a separate bridge
obligation.  The conditional continuum chain lives in the sibling
`ObserverPatchHolography.RepairGapChain`.

SCOPE: machine-checked only on the special pairwise-commuting branch: the
finite representation-gap implication `Δ_rep ≥ c_* > 0` from directly
assumed positive collar rates (Lemma 7.4 / Prop 8.1 / Thm 7.3 assembly), plus
the separate conditional Lemma 7.2 and its unique-scalar sharpening.  No
composition from Lemma 7.2 into the rate premise is formalized.  This is
neither the paper's noncommuting finite-stage theorem nor a proof of any
continuum-certificate premise.

/-- **Lemma 7.2, unique-scalar form.** Under the hypotheses of the imported
    keystone the relaxation rate is more than available: it is the *only*
    positive scalar with `D = cF • (I − E_F)`.

    Existence is `lemma_7_2`.  Uniqueness consumes `|F| ≥ 2`: that hypothesis
    supplies a pair `a ≠ b` of fiber points, and at such a pair the off-diagonal
    entry `(I − E_F) a b = −|F|⁻¹` is nonzero, so two scalars agreeing on
    `cF • (I − E_F)` agree at that entry and hence agree.  On a one-point fiber
    `I − E_F` vanishes and every positive scalar satisfies the equation, which is
    exactly what `|F| ≥ 2` excludes. -/

/-! ## §7.3 assembly: the special commuting finite-gap deliverable -/

/-- **Theorem 7.3 / 7.4 (commuting finite representation gap).** Assume
    each collar rate satisfies `rate a > 0`, then combine Proposition 8.1
    (commuting colors ⇒ constant-rate gap) with the uniform floor (Lemma 7.4):
    the repair generator dominates `c_* · (I − P₀)` with `c_* > 0`.

    The positive-rate premise is an explicit theorem argument.  Although the
    separate `lemma_7_2` can produce a positive scalar for one uniform-fiber
    matrix relaxation, this theorem contains no bridge from that matrix datum
    to `Ec` or `rate` and does not consume `lemma_7_2`.

    This is `Δ_rep ≥ c_* > 0` only on the special pairwise-commuting branch.
    It is not the paper's noncommuting Dobrushin theorem and supplies no
    premise of the continuum receipt without an additional compatibility
    proof.  It says nothing about `Δ_YM`; the continuum bridge
    is not stated, assumed, or proved here.

    Proof shape: `c_* · (I − P₀) ≤ ∑ c_* · (I − E_C) ≤ ∑ c_C · (I − E_C)`, where
    the first `≤` is Prop 8.1 and the second is rate-monotonicity: each summand
    grows because `c_C ≥ c_*` (uniform floor) and `I − E_C ⪰ 0` (star
    projection), so the difference is a sum of positive operators. -/
