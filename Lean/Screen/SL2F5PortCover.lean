# The canonical `SL(2, F5)` cover of the committed port group

The existing bridge identifies Mathlib's `PSL(2,F5)` quotient with the typed
subgroup of the sixty committed twelve-port rotations. This module composes
that isomorphism with the canonical quotient `SL(2,F5) → PSL(2,F5)` and records
the resulting group-level cover of the actual port action.

The map is surjective, its kernel is exactly the scalar center `{+I,-I}`, and
therefore the central element `-I` lies over the identity port rotation. The
commuting square is definitionally the one already certified by the projective
and port-group bridges.

This is deliberately only the canonical finite-group cover interface. In
particular, this file does not identify `SL(2,5)` with the executable
`PORT-SPIN-LIFT` from the super-Tannakian matter certificate, does not identify
that group with the binary icosahedral group, does not construct a faithful
two-dimensional complex spinor representation, does not invoke McKay/E8,
does not select `φ`, and makes no physical-rotation or mass claim.
