# Declared admissible scheduler class and capacity-split obstruction bounds

This module declares one typed admissible scheduler class on the committed
two-register repair carrier `TwoBitRepair.State` and proves the first
scheduler-quantified obstruction bounds for it.

Claim. On the carrier `Bool x Bool`, with the first register read as the
shared network-facing record (the protected observation of the committed
two-bit repair system) and the second register read as the private local
defect flag, the class `AdmissibleScheduler` collects every finite Markov
scheduler whose supported steps do not increase the declared defect mismatch,
write at most one register, and spend at most one unit of expected capacity
per step.  Inside the class the self-update-only sub-class fixes the shared
register on every supported step and the network-update-only sub-class fixes
the private register.  The module proves: both sub-classes are inhabited by
schedulers built from committed fixture kernels; the defective fiber is
unreachable from every consistent state under every scheduler in the class;
the cross fiber (shared register flipped) is unreachable under every
self-update-only scheduler yet is hit with probability one by an explicit
network-update-only scheduler, so any in-class scheduler with a positive
cross hit spends shared capacity on some supported step; the almost-sure
hitting hypothesis of the committed fine fixture is discharged by the
committed repair kernel and refuted by an explicit in-class counterexample
scheduler.

On the committed coarse fixture, whose target admits both shared values from
two declared sources, the module proves the endpoint-uniqueness cut at class
strength: no self-update-only scheduler places the coarse behavior in layer
3, no network-update-only scheduler hits the coarse target from a raised
flag, an explicit merge-then-clear class member outside both sub-classes
places the coarse behavior in layer 3, and every in-class scheduler that
does so spends both shared and private capacity on supported steps.  On the
fine fixture layer 2 equals layer 3 under every scheduler in the class.

Hypotheses.  The class constraints (mismatch non-increase, single-register
locality, unit expected capacity) and the capacity-split reading of the two
registers are architecture declarations, stated as separate named clauses of
one structure.  Every theorem is quantified exactly as written:
all-schedulers-in-class, all-schedulers-in-sub-class, or this-scheduler.

Falsifier.  Any of: an in-class scheduler with a positive defect hit from a
consistent state; a self-update-only scheduler with a positive cross hit; a
proof that the explicit network-update-only scheduler misses the cross fiber;
an in-class scheduler with positive cross hit and zero shared cost on every
supported step; failure of the committed repair kernel to satisfy the class
constraints; a self-update-only scheduler placing the coarse behavior in
layer 3; a network-update-only scheduler with a positive coarse hit from a
raised flag; failure of the merge-then-clear scheduler to satisfy the class
constraints or to place the coarse behavior in layer 3; an in-class
scheduler placing the coarse behavior in layer 3 with zero shared cost or
zero private cost on every supported step.

Nonclaims.  No physical scheduler is selected; the class is a declaration,
not a derivation.  No biological, cognitive, or behavioral claim is made.
All results are on the finite fixtures of the committed development.  The
mismatch, locality, and capacity clauses coincide extensionally with simple
register conditions on this two-register carrier; no generality beyond the
declared carrier is claimed.
