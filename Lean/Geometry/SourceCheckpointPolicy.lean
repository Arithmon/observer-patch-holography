# A finite checkpoint law and its causal implementation

Backward masses on the complete native move tree construct the transition
law. Positive trajectories are exactly terminally accepted trajectories;
the law never samples a failed trajectory and retries it. The finite move
grammar, reference weights and terminal checkpoint remain explicit data.
