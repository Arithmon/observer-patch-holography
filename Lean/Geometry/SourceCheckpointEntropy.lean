# Unique information projection onto a checkpoint face

The finite index type consists of all terminally valid native histories.
Its reference weights are inherited from the complete history reference,
without renormalizing individual prefixes. The normalized restriction is
proved to be the unique minimizer, including candidate laws with zeros.
This proves selection on the named full-history cover; it does not select
that cover, the reference, the horizon or the public record domain.
