# Native calibrated paths and continuation without loss

A receiver can extend a calibrated connected region by sweeping one new
vertex through a simple path of calibrated vertices. The endpoint
sample recovers the new value and the evolved region. This is a construction
from scalar seam means, with no record payload in the schedule. Paths and
their supported incidence remain explicit inputs; no metric menu is selected.
