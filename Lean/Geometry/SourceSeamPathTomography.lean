# Destination-local reconstruction through canonical seam means

A declared path is calibrated from its destination backwards. Each calibration
phase performs one forward sweep through the already calibrated suffix. The
receiver records its own scalar after each phase; remote pre-states are not
inputs to the decoder. All scalar writes are pair means. The theorem establishes
finite exact information transport for this schedule, not a selected routing
law, repeatable immutable-version reads, bounded physical precision or time.
