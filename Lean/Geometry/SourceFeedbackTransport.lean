# Reusable classical transport with declared local feedback

Local immutable-record export, a local zero reset, and factor-two readback
are supplied operations. They are not derived from the canonical pair mean.
The exact hop has unit signal gain; bounded additive errors accumulate
linearly. A labelled semantic read-from refinement preserves the logical
order when its local edge conditions and finite read paths are certified.

The labels say nothing about physical causality. Version sequencing,
write-after-write order and hash-chain order are not semantic read inputs.
No quantum operation, physical clock or source-selected read law is proved.
