# Finite A3 state-selection inequalities

Real reductions of the noncommutative compatible-family argument in
`code/source_publication_selection/STATE_SELECTION.md`. The matrix
mixture-gap estimate follows analytically from Umegaki data processing;
this module does not formalize that matrix theorem or introduce it as an
axiom. All functional inequalities below are explicit theorem hypotheses.
