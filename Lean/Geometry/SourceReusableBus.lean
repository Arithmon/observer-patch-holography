# Finite reusable paired-rail bus

The ideal operations are scalar pair means. Preparation, isolation, schedule,
rail embedding and readout are inputs. A four-cell bus contracts toward its
encoded blank under a seven-mean sweep. Logical payload errors include the
cleanup residual and any separately bounded implementation perturbations.
