# Arbitrary finite paired-rail chains

This is a conditional construction for the candidate scalar pair-mean law.
The rail embedding, initial preparation and controller remain supplied.
Cells 0,...,n form the bus; cells greater than n are untouched archives.
Only cell 0 needs a physical reset rung. Each adjacent copy needs both rail
edges. A weighted bound gives polynomial sufficient cleanup work; it does
not remove the attenuation of a single forward read.
