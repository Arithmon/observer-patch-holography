# Native transfer into a reusable record

A source is retained at half amplitude, a retired destination is overwritten,
and the intervening bus is cleaned by a finite word of scalar means. The
reference state sets the bus to zero only for the error comparison. Every
physical cleanup mean is present in the word and its residual is charged.
The destination has a reset rung; only the first bus cell needs a bus rung.
