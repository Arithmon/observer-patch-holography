# Essential direct reads and the aggregate-read boundary

For a supplied linear record meaning, unrestricted direct coordinate reads
must include every coordinate with a nonzero coefficient, and that condition
is sufficient. Aggregate observations obey a different condition. Neither
the coefficient vector nor a metric radius is selected by this theorem.
