# Consistent publication laws from the derived continuation potential

A harmonic continuation potential defines compatible finite word laws.
Specializing to the least publication potential identifies these laws as
limits of finite-deadline marginals. A recoverable unpublished prefix is
an explicit obstruction to compatibility of the finite-deadline laws.
