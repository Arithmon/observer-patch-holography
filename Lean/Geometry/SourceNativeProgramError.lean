# Composition of native words with explicit comparison errors

Comparison states may discard a cleaned bus only with a proved residual
bound. Concatenation adds those bounds. The physical execution contains no
projection or error-clock reset, and signed disturbances are charged after
every scalar mean, including all cleanup operations and idle-register drift.
