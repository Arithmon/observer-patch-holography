# Finite precision and stationary evaluation

The precision inequality includes a whole-history residual allowance.
Stationary evaluation is an exact shortcut for a deterministic repeated word;
the word's operation count includes every repetition.

/-- With maximum decoding gain `M`, sufficient grid and cleanup precision
give a strict singleton margin. The inequality is independent of the values
of the stored integers. `R` is the sum of all comparison-state residuals. -/
