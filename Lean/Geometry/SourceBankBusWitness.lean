# An inhabited finite bus for every finite bank program

This explicit bus uses the workspace and two scratch cells. It witnesses
the compiler's route premises for every width and every finite request
program. Its star connections are declared graph data; they do not prove an
embedding into the captured W12 graph or source selection.
