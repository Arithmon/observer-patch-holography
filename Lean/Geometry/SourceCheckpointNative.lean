# Composition of native observability, finite feasibility and checkpoint selection

The transition state is a response checkpoint over all admissible
preparations, not a realized payload. Consequently the same transition law
applies to every source intervention. Topology supplies a feasible finite
deadline and the backward recursion supplies a terminating observation law.
Selecting the actual public record interface and physical deadline remains
a source obligation.
