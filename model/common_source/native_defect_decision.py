"""Exact decision experiment for a defect in the existing native load law.

The candidate is one double load above the stationary binary total-two
reference. All 78 states, all thirty seams, both coins and both complete C/E
record menus are retained. No defect register, puncture, link phase, energy
scale or new repair rule is supplied. The source support determines the
configuration-sector obstruction; lifetimes and stationary averages use the
separately declared uniform-attempt calibration, not the production E/F policy.

This exhausts classical configuration invariants, not arbitrary quantum,
record-encoded, actively corrected or enlarged-carrier excitations. The
same collision candidate's survival effect is also checked on the complete
quantum instrument, including arbitrary untouched references. The existing
corrected matching memory is audited separately as a control.
