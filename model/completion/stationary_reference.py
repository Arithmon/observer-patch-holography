"""Construct the exact stationary reference of the adaptive source/bit kernel.

This is the same r=1, epsilon=1/2 controller as adaptive_reference.py, with
classical C/E records reduced to their exposed current sign. It prepares no
coherence and compiles no modular action. The stationary vector is computed
with exact rational linear algebra and certified by its exact residual and
the actual transition support.
